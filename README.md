# Electron Base Application

This is a base electron application example.
It is built with a "gambiarra" inside a docker container, and then, the files are extracted for the local
directory.

# Build the application

Run the script `build-and-extract` and after building the application inside
the container, it will extract the AppImage and other files to the `dist` directory.
